# SpotifyGenreClassification

Developed machine learning models to predict the genre of a song based on its audio features utilizing a publicly available Spotify dataset from Kaggle to source data on tracks and genres. Preprocessed the dataset by selecting key features (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability) and reducing the number of genres to 16 representative classes. Implemented and evaluated multiple classification models, including Random Forests, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks.
